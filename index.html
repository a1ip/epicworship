<blockquote>
<p>As it stands, I have used Epic worship at my place of worship and it has proved itself time and time again. It is my hope that with this tool, growing churches won't have to choose between quality and budget when presenting the gospel. _</p>

<p>We'll be adding a lot of new never-before-seen features to EpicWorship as we go along. As it is open source, I hope you'll join us. There's a place for everyone to help, from coding, to release structuring, to testing, and ESPECIALLY Documentation so join up and lets build something great together!_</p>
